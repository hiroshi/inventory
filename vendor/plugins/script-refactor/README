script/refactor
===============

First of all, if you don't install this via:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/hiroshi/script-refactor.git

You may have no script/refactor. If so, do install.rb by hand:

  ruby vendor/plugins/script-refactor/install.rb

Next, just type:

  script/refactor

You will see the usage and other information of the script.
