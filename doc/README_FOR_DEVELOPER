= Maintenance
This application depends on many plugins.
Home brewed ones are managed as "git submodule", as described in README_FOR_APP, and other external plugins.

Home brewed plugins are:
* script-refactor
* passenger_deploy
* cap_remote_rake

To update other plugins, just re-install them.

 script/plugin install --force {URL}
